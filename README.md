- **Dynamic Grade Calculation**: Polymorphic grading based on student type
- **Class Statistics**: Average grades, pass/fail rates, performance analytics
- **Flexible Grading**: Support for assignments, exams, research papers, thesis, and more

## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Inheritance**: Undergraduate/Graduate students derived from base Student class
- **Polymorphism**: Virtual functions for grade calculation and status reporting
- **Abstract Classes**: Base Student class with pure virtual methods
- **Encapsulation**: Private data with controlled access methods
- **Dynamic Casting**: Runtime type identification for different grading systems
